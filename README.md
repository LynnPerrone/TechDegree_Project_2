List Pagination and Filtering

Project_2 takes a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses and improves the ease of use of the display using JavaScript to paginate and add a navigation system.  A series of links at the bottom of the page let users click through the student entries 10 per page.  Even though the project uses 54 students, the JavaScript solution will respond to any length of list.
